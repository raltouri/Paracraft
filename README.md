# Paracraft

Paracraft is an open-source, voxel-based 3D game engine and creative platform inspired by Minecraft. Built using the Godot Engine, it empowers users to design, build, and script interactive 3D worlds with ease. Whether you're an educator, game developer, or hobbyist, Paracraft offers a flexible environment for creativity and learning.

## Features

* **Voxel-Based Building**: Create intricate structures using a block-based system.
* **Scripting Support**: Enhance interactivity with built-in scripting capabilities.
* **Custom Textures and Materials**: Personalize your world with unique textures and materials.
* **Scene Management**: Organize your projects efficiently with scene-based architecture.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Run Paracraft on various operating systems supported by Godot.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) (version 3.5 or later)
* .NET SDK (for C# scripting)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raltouri/Paracraft.git
   ```

2. **Open in Godot**: Launch Godot and open the `project.godot` file located in the cloned repository.

3. **Build the Project**: Use Godot's build tools to compile and run the project.

## Project Structure

* `materials/` - Contains material definitions for various in-game objects.
* `resources/` - Houses additional resources like scripts and assets.
* `scenes/` - Includes scene files that define different game environments.
* `scripts/` - Contains C# and GDScript files for game logic and functionality.
* `textures/` - Stores texture images used for in-game objects and environments.

## Project Progress Plan

Our project followed a weekly plan, working every Monday from January 6, 2025, to May 19, 2025, with varied hours around an average of 7 per week.
